      The "milksteak" Charlie refers to is a literal steak boiled in milk. He orders it "boiled over hard, with a side of your finest Jelly Beans, served raw."

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        1 medium 8.8oz. (.25Kg) flat iron steak (top blade shoulder steak)
      </li>
      <li>2 cup milk (preferably whole, called "4%")</li>
      <li>1/4 cup honey</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp cinnamon</li>
      <li>1/2 tsp nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tsp vanilla extract</li>
      <li><strong>Garnish:</strong></li>
      <li>1/2 cup Jelly Belly&reg; jelly beans</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the milk, honey, cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla to a medium sized saucepan.</li>
        <li>Heat up the mixture, stirring until the honey has completely dissolved.</li>
        <li>Bring the mixture to the boil.</li>
        <li>Carefully place the steak in the boiling milk mixture</li>
        <li>Bring the liquid back to the boil and reduce the heat so that the milk is simmering.</li>
        <li>Cook this medium-sized steak for five minutes on one side, stirring the top occasionally to stop a skin forming on the milk.</li>
        <li>Turn the steak over and cook for a further five minutes on the other side.</li>
        <li>Check how well cooked your steak <em>If you're after authenticity, the steak should be cooked "over hard" and so should not be pink at all.</em></li>
        <li>Allow the steak to rest for a few minutes.</li>
        <li>Garnish with jelly beans.</li>
    </ol>
