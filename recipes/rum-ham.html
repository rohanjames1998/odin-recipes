    <p>In The 7 Secrets of Awakening the Highly Effective Four-Hour Giant, Today (The Gang Writes A Self-Help Book), Frank reveals the ingredients and recipe to cook a rum-ham.
    </p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 10-pound canned ham</li>
        <li>1 hunting knife</li>
        <li>3 1-litters bottles of rum</li>
        <li>1 handgun</li>
        <li>1 box handgun ammo</li>
        <li>1 bunch of Italian parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Directions:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>De-can ham (for instructions, see back of can).</li>
        <li>Using the hunting knife, carve a hole in the top of the ham wide enough to hold the mouth of a rum bottle.</li>
        <li>Open first rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole. If you made your hole deep enough, it should stand up there on it's own.</li>
        <li>Load gun</li>
        <li>Open second rum bottle and upend it into your ham hole (the one in your face this time). As the liquid flows into your mouth, swallow at regular intervals.</li>
        <li>Repeat step five until bottle is empty.</li>
        <li>Open third bottle of rum and repeat step six.</li>
        <li>Remove safety from handgun.</li>
        <li>Wait for ham pirates.</li>
        <li>Shoot ham pirates.</li>
        <li>Reload gun.</li>
        <li>Repeat steps eight through eleven until rum has been fully absorbed into ham, usually about twelve hours.</li>
        <li>Garnish with parsley and serve.</li>
    </ol>
